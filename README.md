# Electric-Bill-Calculator-
This program calculates the monthly electricity bill for a consumer based on the type of consumer (h for house, c for commercial) and the number of electricity units consumed. It uses nested and chained if–else statements to determine the price per unit and then computes the total bill.

## Purpose

To calculate the total electricity bill based on user input for units consumed and consumer type, practicing nested if–else logic and conditional branching.

## Logic

• Input consumer type (h for house, c for commercial).

• Input number of units consumed.

• Based on units and type:

### ≤ 200 units:

House: 10 per unit

Commercial: 12 per unit

### 201–400 units:

House: 12 per unit

Commercial: 15 per unit

### > 400 units:

House: 15 per unit

Commercial: 20 per unit

Multiply unit price by units consumed to calculate the total bill.

Display the final bill amount.

## Example Input/Output
1. Enter h for house consumer and c for commercial user: h
   Enter the amount of units consumed: 250
   Your electricity bill of this month is 3000.

2. Enter h for house consumer and c for commercial user: c
   Enter the amount of units consumed: 500
   Your electricity bill of this month is 10000.
