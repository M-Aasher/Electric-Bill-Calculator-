# Electric-Bill-Calculator-
This program calculates the monthly electricity bill for a consumer based on the type of consumer (h for house, c for commercial) and the number of electricity units consumed. It uses nested and chained ifâ€“else statements to determine the price per unit and then computes the total bill.
